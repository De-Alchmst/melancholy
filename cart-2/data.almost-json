// Continuations are also used in models of computation including denotational semantics, the actor model, process calculi
// facepalm
// WHAT THE HELL AM I READING?!
// uhhh... maybe some examples could help.
// def1
// Let's look at the following definition.
// ------
// (define (factorial num)
//   (call/cc (lambda (k)
//     (let loopty-loop ((acc 1) (num num))
//       (if (> num 0)
//         (loopty-loop (* acc num) (- num 1))
//         acc)))))
// ------
// reading1
// this example... does not use the continuation. It is good at showcasing, that you probably don't need call/cc anyways.
// Probably...
// def2
// Next example!
// ------
// (define (first-positive lst)
//   (call-with-current-continuation
//     (lambda (return)
//       (for-each
//         (lambda (itm)
//           (when (and (number? itm) (> itm 0))
//             (return itm)))
//         lst)

// Great, now we know that one can use continuations to turn Scheme into a shitty Python. 
// Is this a good thing?
// reading-intersection
// Who knows!
// Can you turn python into a shitty Scheme?
// reading-intersection
// Probably.
// But the main idea one should take from this example is that you can use both call/cc and call-with-current-continuation to call a function with the current continuation.
// Also, note that call/cc passes it's continuation to it's argument.
// explaning1
// The argument lambda can return a value like normal, but the call/cc also returns when it's continuation is called, kind of like a return in Algolic languages.

// This mignt not be that interesting,

// This is not why I converted!
// i-hear-you-say

// ih3
// You still own me money,
// i-hear-you-say
// I hear you say.
// explaning2
// Well, the funner part is that continuations are not limited to the call/ccs scope.
// def3
// Consider this example.
// ------
// (define (fou xx xy)
//   (let ((K (call/cc (lambda (K) K))))
//     (if (procedure? K)
//       K
//       (xx (xy K)))))
//     
// (define brar
//   (fou (lambda (x)
//          (+ 69 x))
//        (lambda (x)
//          (* 3  x))))
//     
// (if (procedure? brar)
//   (brar 117)
//   (display brar))
// ------
// If my code,
// pointing-forward
// by which I mean your Scheme,
// is correct, it should return a funny number.
// Here we see that when the continuation is called, it actually resets the program counter to the point where it was created, but replaces itself with the argument, meaning that brar actually gets redefined as well.
// reading2
// If this just looks like a more esoteric goto...
// def4
// Next example.
// *drawing of the tree of life with some lambda-nonsence sprinkled in*
// Here we can...
// def5
// Next example.
// *goes back to the previous example*
// Here notice how when we bind a continuation to K, we can check for it with procedure?, because it's still just a function *or procedure shot* after all.
// Then when we call the continuation with a slightly less funny number, it is no longer a *function or procedure thing* and  we return (xx (xy)) with it.
// This then gets returned to the brar definition and gets displayed.
// How do we handle passing a function *the procedure thing* to the contnuation?
// sitting-intersectin
// Who knows,
// it's not like this is the intended usecase anyways...
// The intended usecase is to write macros to emulate Algolian switch or try, so naturally no-one does that for purism reasons or something.
// You can use it for return, however. But if you use CHICKEN
// pointing-forward
// (as you should),
// there is a let/cc in miscmacros to make your life easier
// ------
// (include scheme (chicken base)
//          miscmacros)
// 
// (define foorfoor (*pentagram*)
//   (let/cc exit
//      (exit 666)))
