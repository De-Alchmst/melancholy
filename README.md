# Melancholy

This is the Melancholy 'surrealist programming' project.
It consists (or will eventually consist) of multiple smaller
`[E X P E R I E N C E]`s. Each `[E X P E R I E N C E]` is it's own stand-alone
program, but they are all part of one bigger unit.
Think of it as a music album, just instead of music, it's programs.

Feel free to read the source code, it's part of the `[E X P E R I E N C E]`!

Or don't; I'm not your mother. (unless...)
